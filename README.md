Assumptions

Node.js version: This project assumes you are using Node.js version 14 or later.
Email provider: This project uses a mock email provider for demonstration purposes. You may need to replace this with a real email provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) and configure it accordingly.
Rate limiting: The rate limiting mechanism is implemented using a simple in-memory store. In a production environment, you may want to use a more robust rate limiting solution (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
Circuit breaker: The circuit breaker implementation is a basic example and may need to be adapted to your specific use case.
Error handling: This project assumes that errors will be handled and logged appropriately. You may want to add additional error handling and logging mechanisms to suit your needs.
